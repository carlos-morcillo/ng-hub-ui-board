## [19.3.2] - 2025-01-15

### Changed
- Improved `reachedEnd` event documentation in README with correct usage examples showing `event.data` as the complete `BoardColumn` object
- Updated `reachedEnd` event example to include proper container with fixed height requirement for scroll detection
- Enhanced license section in README with detailed explanation of CC BY 4.0 permissions, requirements, and attribution example

### Fixed
- Corrected misleading `reachedEnd` event documentation that incorrectly showed direct access to `event.data.title` instead of extracting the column first

## [19.3.1] - 2024-10-05

### Added
- Comprehensive JSDoc coverage across public models, directives, pipes, and the `HubBoardComponent` for improved API discoverability.
- New unit test ensuring the `reachedEnd` event is not emitted when column data is unavailable.

### Changed
- Refined infinite-scroll detection tolerance to ensure `reachedEnd` fires reliably at the bottom of each column.
- Hardened the document example logic to avoid duplicate lazy-load requests while columns are already loading.
- Typed the `invertColor` pipe output and improved error handling for invalid HEX values.
